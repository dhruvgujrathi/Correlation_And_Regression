# Correlation_And_Regression
Linear Regression is used to predict or determine the value of an outcome variable based on one or many variables. This is done to establish a linear relationship (linear equation) between the outcome variable and the remaining variables. Regression analysis is a widely used tool to determine the connection or relationship between two variables. The variables are related to eachother through an equation where the power of both these variables are 1 and the if one visualizes the equation, it can be depicted using straight line. If there is an error in the equation, it will create a curve. The equation can be depicted as follows: Y = ax+b where a and b are constants, x is the predictor variable and Y is the response variable. Correlation is one of the most common statistics. Using one single value, it describes the "degree of relationship" between two variables. Correlation ranges from -1 to +1. Negative values of correlation indicate that as one variable increases the other variable decreases. Positive values of correlation indicate that as one variable increase the other variable increases as well. There are three options to calculate correlation in R, and we will introduce two of them below.
